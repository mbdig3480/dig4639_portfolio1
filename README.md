## New Features

There are 2 new features in my react app. The first is a component called <Info>. In this component, it gets the exerciseInfo as a prop. It describes the info about what exercises are in the app. The second is a component called <Questionnaire>. In this component, it gets exerciseType1 and exerciseType2 as props. It thanks the user for doing the exercise types in the app.
